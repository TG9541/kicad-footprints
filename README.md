# KiCad Footprints

My "local" KiCad footprints, essentially Chinese low-cost components for hobby projects like breakout boards.

Note: this library contains a KiCad footprint for a generic OLED display 0.96" 128x64 (SSD1306 based) that fits both "old style (27x27mm²) and "new style" (25x27mm², same active area, smaller glass).
